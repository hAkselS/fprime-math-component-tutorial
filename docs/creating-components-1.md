# Creating Components

## Part 1: Starting the MathSender

Start by creating and navigating to the directory where the components will live. 

```shell 
# In: MathProject
mkdir Components
cd Components 
```

The MathSender is going to be an active component which will send receive parameters, send parameters, log events, and send telemetry. With this is mind, use the following command to create the MathSender component. 

```shell
# In: Components
fprime-util new --component 
```
This command will prompt you for some inputs. You should specify the follow so that the components matches the short description above. 

```

[INFO] Found CMake file at 'MathProject/project.cmake'
Add component Components/MathSender to MathProject/project.cmake at end of file (yes/no)? yes
Generate implementation files (yes/no)? yes
```
Before doing anything to the files you have just generated, try building. 

```shell 
# In: Components
fprime-util build
```

Now that you have created the component, you can implement the component behavior. The first part of implementing component behavior is editting the fpp file. The fpp file will specify what goes into the autogenerated cpp and hpp files. Writing the fpp file will not implement component behavior on its own, but it will generate templates for everything you will need to write in cpp. 

In Components/MathSender, open MathSender.fpp and entirely replace its contents with the following. (Note: this is an old format of fpp files but the content is entirely correct. @TOTO).

```
module MathModule {

  @ Component for sending a math operation
  active component MathSender {

    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                           op: MathOp @< The operation
                           val2: F32 @< The second operand

                        op: MathOp @< The operation
                        val2: F32 @< The second operand
                      ) \

      format "Math command received: {f} {} {f}"

    @ Received math result
    event RESULT(
                  result: F32 @< The math result
                ) \
      severity activity high \
      format "Math result is {f}"

    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    @ The first value
    telemetry VAL1: F32

    @ The operation
    telemetry OP: MathOp

    @ The second value
    telemetry VAL2: F32

    @ The result
    telemetry RESULT: F32

  }

}
```

More about this component @TODO 

Now you have written the F' code for the component, but the cpp and hpp files do not yet reflect the changes you have made to the fpp file. To get the cpp and hpp to reflect the specs you have set fourth in the fpp, you need to use F' imlpement as done below. 

```shell
# In: Components
fprime-util impl 
```

If you look in Components, you will see that two new files, MathSender.cpp-template and MathSender.hpp-template. The template files are the files we just generated using our fpp model. So as to not burn down any work that had been done in the orginal MathSender.cpp or hpp, whenever F' generates code, its created a new file. In this case, you did not write anything into MathSender.cpp or .hpp. So, you can use a move command to write the new, generated MathSender.cpp and .hpp, over the old MathSender.cpp and .hpp. 

Use the following to write the new MathSender.cpp and .hpp over the old .cpp and .hpp.

```shell 
# In: MathSender
mv MathSender.cpp-template MathSender.cpp
mv MathSender.hpp-template MathSender.hpp
```

Build MathSender to make sure everything worked as expecred.

```shell 
# In: MathSender 
fprime-util build 
```
